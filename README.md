# Global-Power-Rankings-Hackathon
League of Legends is one of the most popular esports games. Riot Games operates 9 leagues internationally, each league with their own ranking system. The goal of this project is to develop a ranking system that ranks all LoL esports teams globally, ranks teams in a given tournament, and to rank a given list of teams.
